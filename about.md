## About SORA
The School of Representational Art (SORA) was founded in 1992 by artist and instructor Bruno Surdo and is located in the artistic River North area of Chicago. The school was established to bring the great painting tradition of the Old Masters to a new generation of artists.

SORA offers a highly structured and integrated course of study designed to allow a student to attain a high degree of ability in representational drawing and painting. The course of study replicates the atelier system of art instruction and continues a tradition of training whose lineage connects directly to the great European academic and impressionistic painting schools of the 18th and 19th centuries. SORA's link to this heritage is through Richard Lack and his school of classical realism. All of the instructors at SORA are practicing professional artists and either SORA graduates themselves or graduates of Atelier Lack.

Within the structured curriculum, students at SORA focus on developing their perceptive, technical and conceptual faculties and cultivating skills in drawing, painting, and picture composition. The atmosphere is one of collaborative learning, individualized instruction, and dedication to creating fine art with a high level of craftsmanship.
