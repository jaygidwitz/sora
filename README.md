<p>Established in 1992, The School of Representational Art (SORA) was Chicago's original drawing and painting Atelier. The school offered a program and environment in which a student could learn, practice and develop fine art skills in the great classical European tradition.</p>

The program was superceded by [Atelier Eftimov](https://www.ateliereftimov.com) in 2015.
